### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on production ML systems in python to support clinical outreach teams.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning containerization with Docker and Kubernetes/Kubeflow, cloud computing with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and deep learning applications with Tensorflow and Pytorch.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ways to incorporate ideas from causal inference to create more transparent and robust machine learning models and systems.
